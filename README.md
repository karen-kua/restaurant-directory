# Open Table Assessment - Karen Kua

## Purpose

This app uses the Open Table API in order to query for restaurants on the Open Table platform in a given city. 

## Main Functionalities

* Users will enter in a city in order to retrieve a list of restaurants in the area.
* Each restaurant will be rendered as a card on the screen. Each card can be expanded/collapsed. If the card is expanded, the address, name, price, and a link to its Open Table profile will be provided.  If the card is collapsed, only the name will be shown. 
* Users will be able to query the list of results by restaurant name 
* Each successful API call will have its response data stored in the local storage.  As such, when users refresh the page, their resulting list of restaurants will persist. 

## Technologies/Tools

React.js, JavaScript, ES6/ES7, Bootstrap, HTMl, CSS, Axios, YARN

## Installation

* In the command line, cd into the root of the folder
* Run `yarn install` at the root using your command line 
* After installing all the node modules, run `yarn start` in the command line 
* This app will take up port 3000, but your terminal will request for you to switch ports if port 3000 is already occupied
